      <h1>About</h1>

      <p> Lets Eat! is the brainchild of Kelly Fitzsimmons & Terry Wilson, veterans of the service industry with 15 years of combined experience.<br> Terry is the creative force behind "Le Chine petite sous" of Beverly Hills. In 2018, the two decided they HAD to open a restaurant that would pay homage to small plates and clean meals as well as give back to the community.</p>

      <p> The project would be named "Lets Eat!" because this is the first thing Kelly said to Terry, when they met at a cooking class in Silverlake. The restaurant idea was simple: serve fresh food at a very affordable price and nourish the community. Lets Eat! also operates a food pantry that can be accessed Monday -Friday and features pay what you can pricing model on the weekends. "We really want to change how people view food and teach our community how to live better lives".</p>  

      <p> Kelly and Terry want Lets Eat! to feel welcoming and warm as if you're in a family or close friends house. The restraunt is set up like a family home with a living room for comfy socializing with firends, a dining room with bench seating and a unique outdoor room with poofs on the grass, benches and standing tables. The dinnerware is a mishmash of handmade pieces from local super starts "Of Herron" and vintage dinnerware Kelly has collected over the years.
      </p> 

      <p> They hope to continue to grow Lets Eat! for years to come and inspire other Angelenos to open small businesses and invest in their communities.
